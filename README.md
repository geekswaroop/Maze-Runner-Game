# maze-runner
A popular maze runner game implemented using C++ and OpenGL. Developed during my second semester as part of IEEE-Envision.

```
g++ <program.cpp> -lglut -lGL -lGLU -o program.out
./program.out
```

### Contributing
Create a fork and clone the fork to your system. Add the upstream remote using the command
```git remote add upstream https://github.com/geekswaroop/Maze-Runner-Game.git```
Always fetch the latest changes to the master branch by doing ```git pull upstream master``` in your master branch and create pull requests by creating new branches with relevant names and making the respective changes in those branches.
